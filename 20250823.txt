love is a discontinuity of feeling that produces a continuity of action
it is a unique state in this regard. most states, take depression or mania, are mentally continuous in ways that interrupt action.
love, on the other hand, disorders the mind but creates a stable pattern of behavior toward the object of affection. it emerges at the point that the obsessed or lust- stricken chooses to persist in action beyond persistence of feeling.
