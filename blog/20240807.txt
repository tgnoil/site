your honor may I approach the bench

you may

an old dog on a porch, looking up wearily

time settled around the courtroom, stray coughs.

your honor, the lawyer whispered, the evidence--it's admissible, all of it.

what evidence, said the judge, none has been presented.

exhibits A-D, they have strong bearing on my client's case, and attest inconvertibly to his innocence.

your honor, continued the lawyer, rubbing his chin, what would you say to this?

I will engage my opponent in a duel, ten paces, him to the [south] and myself to the [north]

go on, said the judge, pulling out a toothbrush out of robes.

if, said the lawyer, I maim but do not kill my opponent, you will acknowledge that (1) there is evidence and (2) it is admissible. If I kill my opponent, you will rule in the favor of my client, innocent of all charges.

you have no client, said the judge, spreading a thick blue smear of paste.

furthermore, continued the lawyer, if my opponent maims but does not kill me, then I will acknowledge that I have no evidence, no client, and that this is not a court of law. if he kills me, well, he will not kill me. I have it on heavenly authority.

the judge gingerly poured water from his glass onto the brush--too much, and it spilled onto his robes.

ah, bailiff, napkins please. the judge wiped at the wet spot irritably.

well, your honor?

do as you please, the judge snapped. I'm not a judge.

very well, said the lawyer. he walked briskly back to his seat, unclasped his gator skin portmanteau and withdrew a ornate flintlock pistol.

he began polishing the pewter piece as the jury looked on disinterestedly.

this went on for some time, and may very still be.
