CHARLEY & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY
Encountered an interesting reading of Charley and the Chocolate Factory as  soteriological story  wherein Wonka functions as God figure and the children as prospective initiates into his Eleusinian mysteries, full participation in which can only be achieved through a harrowing process of descent (i.e. into the heart of the factory as Testing or Proving ground), searching/striving (i.e. undergoing a series of temptations), and finally ascent (up and unto the lofty heights of divine perspective and insight, figured as glass elevator, the speed and maneuverability of which stands in stark contrast to cheap thrill of the purloined fizzy lifting drink). The fates and failings of the various children lends them an allegorical aspect (Gloop as Gluttony, Salt as Pride, Teevee as Sloth, etc.) with only Charley emerging victorious. In this sense, he sits squarely within the classical heroic tradition, a moral exemplar/paragon of virtue whose temperance, endurance, and humble origin renders him the only worthy successor to Wonka's empire of Joy and Play. The golden ticket then is no mere fungible token, monetary/material asset, or social credit, but rather a kind of moral voucher, a  key to the kingdom  which is not of this world but of one beyond, and which consequently only the meek may inherit.
