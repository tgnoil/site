LESSON 2
I Vow to Thee My Country

it is said, by me and i'm sure others, that the grander the sentiment the falser.
this is itself a grandiose sentiment, for what that's worth.

now: 
listen to Holst's Thaxted, with Sir Cecil Spring Rice's setting of words. this is a patriotic hymn, and there are few grander.

particularly, this line: "her fortess is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering."

if this does not raise a lump in your throat, you'd best look elsewhere for a lifeline; I've nothing to give you; you haven't the requisite appetite for grandeur and falsity.*

now: listen again

now: again, again, with sharpened resolution.

oh you strange grand freak, listen, you peculiar victim of time, who contains a whole proud land of unsaid things within you: rejoice to suffer, bear it up with dignity, cling to the suffering as to life itself. let it be mother and father and spouse. 

*(how is this: you've set out to help me become my self and so soon abandon you project?? No. here is the lesson for one such as you: there is no self for you to be until you have come to terms with your grand fundamental falsehood. keep listening, again and again and again.)
