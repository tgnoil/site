PROGRESS
Working theory: every major cultural movement of the past two centuries commonly called upon as evidence of social progress and growth is in fact evidence to the contrary insofar as it subversively promotes (and indeed originates from) the elite attempt not to  better the world  or any such nonsense but rather to consolidate power (e.g. by destabilizing the family unit through women s lib), massify opinion (e.g. indoctrinating the youth with a curriculum of  tolerance  and  open-mindedness  through mandatory public education that renders them increasingly susceptible to propaganda), delocalize identity (e.g. racializing issues of local sovereignty and affiliation, except where these affiliations pose no threat [i.e. minorities]), increase surveillance (e.g. establishing psychological and technological mechanisms of censorship and enforcement against  hate speech  [read: the crime of critical individual thought] in the name of  promoting civil discourse ) and control population growth (e.g. discouraging procreation through celebration of  alternative  same-sex lifestyles and reproductive rights). 
It has nothing to with  basic human rights  and everything to with base human desires, specifically the desire for unfettered power and control.
[NOTE: I am not saying that any of these things are  bad  as such simply that they can be traced, I think convincingly, to ulterior motives that are incongruent with the alleged altruism/lofty humanism of the progressive agenda.]
