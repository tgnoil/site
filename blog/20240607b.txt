there's a thermostat in your soul...you can adjust it any time, the heat of anger, the coldness of dread, just slide your thermostat to the left or right  there's a release valve on the sode of your jead, twist it to let out the bad mental pictures, the imaginary negative buildup  there's a quiet untouchable place at my center. i can go there any time I please  eat your problems, terrors, inconveniences. crush them uo, swallow them down...derive what nutritive substance you can, then shit the rest out
