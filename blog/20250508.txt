what need have we to automote
by hurtling bus or car
when we've the means to ambulate
more happily by far

on these soft limbs
though not so fast; what lies ahead in time or distance vast
that could outpace
the shining wreckage of our reckless race
save its pedestrian hymns?

barefoot, the spirit sidles o'er
to long old wanderers
who hum and dream 
far off the speeding corridors.
