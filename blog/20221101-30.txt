COWBOY BEBOP
A stylized and visually striking pastiche of noir, spaghetti western, space opera, Kung Fu, and blaxploitation conventions, Cowboy Bebop takes place in a far future Sol system with an unlikely cast of cantankerous bounty hunters, whose intergalactic rambles serve as narrative/thematic entry points into questions of fate, memory, morality, belonging, technological proliferation, social massification, and more explored episodically and tenderly, humorously across boundaries of time, space, and generic distance.
