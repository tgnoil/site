capitalism, gadfly thinks, is like a great catapult cranked ever tighter by a large body, the social body, whose size and strength is determined by how much product it eats (launched maybe into its mouth by a series of smaller catapults manned by bodies fed in like manner), and back and back it goes, storing the sweat and energy of Man (this is Capital) in the taut ropes of Mechanism against judgment day, with its final payload straight to the mouth of God.
