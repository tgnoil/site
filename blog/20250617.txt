Ramanujans lost notebook was the source of some controversy
scholars tugged their collars
And declared it bunk preemptively
"Better off lost"

let's be charitable
how could they know
the sweetness of Laxmi's kiss
In the fitful night
Or the taste of Narasimha's blood, expressed mathematically.
How could they have anticipated
Or thought to pursue
The elliptic path that the comet takes
Through elements.

What clarity!
To commit the thoughts of God
To looseleaf sheaves
Eternity in a bounded function
