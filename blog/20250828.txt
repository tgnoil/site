"yoga with toga"
hello. im here in the beautiful land of hawaii, ane the natural beauty of it.

and we're going to do a practice today and a really calm esy flow to help you in your day and find the spcae and realy make the space that you deserve to have in youe practice of yoga.

so what we're gonna is come to a nice comfy sit on our mats, and if you have carpet, thats basically mat and we just going to take a moment breathe and close our eyes *inhale* *exhale* 

and just really find that inner place, maybe its hawaii for you, like where i am, in the natural beauties or maybe its just a nice place like a park or a forest or somewhere like that.

and if you want to do your hands like this, to be more like one of the yoga guys, uou definitely can. 

and awareness, is the key here. maybe theres a sore place that youre really sore in, maybe you bumped your head or you have arthritis, yoga can help cleanse that away with some really deep breaths and moves and stuff. lift and lengthen and two more times

and if you want to do it really fast, like if you have somewhere, you can put his video on 1.5 2x and you can do even more yoga that way, like doing two videos for the time of one.

okay, lets bat our eyes open, and were gonna do our first yoga, really lengthen and lift ourselves up to shiva the exalted one.

so like I'm doing, basically do that. its shavasana on your mat. and really juet keep breathing and do the yoga moves as best ou can.
