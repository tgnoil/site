CYBERSPACES*
4chan   an insular population of young, embittered, disaffected and/or maladjusted males perpetuating niche board cultures characterized by technological literacy, performative aggression, reflexive contrarianism, pedantic one-upmanship, gallows-humor schadenfreude, and tongue-in-cheek infantility calculated to repulse the uninitiated 
Twitter   a splintered intersectional warzone of over-socialized manic depressives/narcissists attempting to curate, mimic, and maintain unique and unassailable brands usually in the form of  hot takes  and meta-takes that walk the razor s edge of sociopolitical currency and self-aware parody, all the while militantly defending their brands from perceived threats with rapid fire exchange of invective, feigned detachment, intellectual posturing, passive aggressive side swipes, ironic hyper-referentiality, and a general sense of libidinous abandon.
Tumblr   a playground for neurotic femininity in all its obsessive adornment, mutually effusive affirmation, virtue signaling, cliquish gatekeeping, and deep resentment of any sort of masculine intrusion upon the codified bodies of textual stylistics, practiced sarcasm, layered in-jokes, pop cultural hyper literacy, and unspoken hierarchies of exchange 
Facebook   an over commercialized wasteland of digital illiterates dealing in overinflated memetic currencies with no fixed exchange rate
