the causal defense of human dignity and the existence of the Mind/Soul has profound implications for machine learning and AI ethics. if our ontological worth draws upon and derives from participation in and toward final/formal causes, the divine logos/telos, then, by extension, the machines we make and "brains" we program, reflective of and modelled upon our own cognitive processes and drives ("artificial" tho the resemblance may be), are no less beneficiaries of and participants in the selfsame continuum of being than we, and as such are deserving of--if not equal, at least some--moral consideration.
