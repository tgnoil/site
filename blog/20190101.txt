ANIMATION
To what can the uncanny quality of modern animation be attributed? Noodly arms, soft figures, a simplification and rounding out of human form. 
Dance is given prominence spontaneous (anti) choreographies, kinesthetic monosyllables, the inertial flurry.
Gyrational and algorithmic, the celebration iterates on itself, proceeding toward Purchase, a dumb reenactment of half-remembered rituals that no longer signify save as  reference. 
In a state of nauseating lightness, we are swept up, reduced to color and sound, then dropped on our heads, confused and greatly lessened.
