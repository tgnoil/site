LESSON 1

watch the crab fight the robot 10 to 15 times. 

note the naturally defensive posture of the crab. he lies low as the blade swings.

backing up, unperturbed, he raises his claw and catches the blade, as if by accident; it slots in harmlessly. 

it's as if the mechanical adversary, for all its rotational superiority, was built custom to fail against the crab.

the machine's offensive prowess is false and exhibitive. the crab's defensive prowess is actual. 

a low-lying attitude and a strong slow claw are its birthright, and its sure defense against [a href="samsara"]all that whirls[/a]. 

I won't spell it out. Watch it 10 to 15 times more. 

Despite its victory over the machine, the crab will still be [a href="heat death"]boiled[/a] and eaten. against that, the crab has no recourse.

It has bought itself nothing except a little time and the respect of the gods who stage these battles for their amusement.
