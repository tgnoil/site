thought experiment (modified trolley)
theres a stationary trolley loaded with goods
a person is tied to the track such that he will be permanently maimed, but not killed, if the trolley passes over
at the station beyond him is a large group of people
they would experience a great deal of pleasure by recieving the goods
if you send the trolley over, one person will experience great pain and many people will experience great pleasure
if you do nothing, no experiences pain or pleasure

most people i think would choose to do nothing. why? because we intuitively recognize that absence of pain is better than presence of pleasure.

now think of it this way...having a child ties him to busy tracks or places him on the platform. is it ethical to have a child if there is a chance he will experience great pain? is that worth the possibility that he will experience great pleasure?
