why read non fiction when ai exists?
im not being coy. it's a legitimate question. what is the point of taking in longform texts except as an obsolete mental exercise?
there's the attention span argument, but on its own, it's weak. (1) there's more enjoyable ways to train focus and (2) again, not being coy, why do we need pre-tech attention spans in a post-tech world?

in response to (1), maybe you say "i enjoy nonfiction" in which case dont let me stop you.i happen to despise it on the whole.

a novel is worlds more fun, and a good film is even better.

anyways, it seems like the alarmism around the death of books stems less from actual concerns about the atrophy in public discourse or the decline of learnedness and more about losing elistist barriers and ego buffing that the well read benefitted from for a long time.

an LLM can spin up a cogent and concise summary of the most impenetrable tome in less time than it would take some B&N tote flaunting dweeb to crack the spine on their latest flavour of the month NYT best seller.

if i can learn what i need to learn fast easy and free, and get to the heart of the thing, without slogging through the 100-odd pages of requisite filller that modern publishers inexplicably demand, why wouldnt i?
