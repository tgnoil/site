pkd is a bad writer but in that endearingly eager and clunky way peculiar to sci fi writers, where their imaginative reach exceeds their expressive grasp; in this genre, characters and their interactions are either (1) transparent vehicles for concept, as in the case of hard sci fi (unfettered autism) or (2) amateurish refractions of the author's internal struggle to comprehend and participate in emotion (self aware autism, as in pkd's case)
