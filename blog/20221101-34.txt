KARMA CHAMELEON
Culture club, boy George, sade (UK Sophisti-pop, blue eyed soul)
The karma chameleon is a master of emotional camouflage, using affective fluctuations, polychromatic adjustments, and panoramic binocularity to disguise true intentions, evade capture/domestication at the hands of the possessive lover (figured as rival or predator), and mute the lurid palette of the idealized dreamscape (red gold and green). They may come and go as they please, unburdened by moral convictions or the need to  sell contradictions  by way of synchronized monocular vision (characteristics which, humorously enough, are projected onto the poor lover in an antagonistic moment projection as protection).
