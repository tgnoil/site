ANTI-OEDIPUS
thought : 4chan as case study/model/entry point into potentialities of Deleuze and Guattari's group-subject which--through its infernal mechanics of contrarian oscillation (theoretica), libidinal memetics (erotica/poesis), and militant role/troll-play ([dys]praxis, politica), gets beyond the fascistic neuroses and repressive codes of prevailing (tri)unitary bourgeois programmatics toward a new and vital technology of desire--neither collective nor singular, but schizophrenized, anonymized, deoedipalized, anti-egoic. flowing where it will, as it will, equal parts productive and deconstructive.
