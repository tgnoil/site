friendship is a liability to the "down" fellow.
acquaintance will do fine in these cases, call it what you wish. 
others: 
get a wife from catalogs; she'll do you better--for simple squares, I mean; I address them. with cunning succor and a soft death, you will not know or care. for simple squares, I mean.
for the many-sided man, well, a true friend is all there is to hope for, and good luck. I wouldn't hold your breath, were I you, which I am.
