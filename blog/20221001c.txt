SOUL RETREIVAL
In soul retrieval, professional shaman/quack Villoldo proposes a four chambered model of the psyche as primordial Eden (chamber of wounds, of contracts, of grace, of treasure). These chambers map astonishingly well to the four-phrase mantra of Ho Opononpono: I am sorry (acknowledgement of mutual wounding), please forgive me (contractual erasure of wrongdoing), thank you (granting of grace), I love you (the largesse, the mother lode/lobe, the Treasure)
