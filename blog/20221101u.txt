SPHERE
Life tends spherical. Family as binary star system, celestial bodies with varying climates, irregularities/eccentricities, albedos, day/night cycles, and orbital paths, all bound together by gravitational force and common source (implosion/explosion of starstuff as both an origination & extinction event), some even possessing satellites of their own (orbits within orbits).
systems form clusters, clusters form galaxies, galaxies form superstructures, and superstructures expand and contract around some unknown point of cosmic origin that we can call the Great Mother (space/void/womb), penetrated by the Great Father of Time(lessness) (the phallic shaft of light)
