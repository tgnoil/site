[abstract: getting beyond the tired and grim "apparatus" of postmodern theory and its machinc body of metaphors. what about a new terminological/analogical frame, rooted in the natural world, unencumbered by anthropocentrism, aired out]
postmodern theory relies on a set of abstracted, unnatural metaphors and terms that destabilize our understanding of the world and our ability to engage with it in natural ways.
I propose a new frame, a new vocabulary for theory that is rooted in the natural world, the fundamental material of all things, the dirt beneath us and the sky above. then I propose that this new frame be applied to postmodern theorists, both individually and in their entirety, to see what can be meaningfully translated to the new natural theory and what fails to hold.
I believe this is necessary if we are to heal the fracture, to again bring ourselves into proper relation with the world around us. It is not regression that I propose, but a reclamation of our birthright, a maturation, an advance beyond this adolescent stage of paranoia, doubt, and misgiving--the age of smoke and mirrors and obfuscation--in which we have too long languished.
so what are these new metaphors? of what is this new "apparatus" composed? it is composed of the thing around us: earth, water, fire, sky. Green things and brown things and red things and blue things, with a great spirit that binds them.
Aristotle and the greeks will be our guide. They will be our virgil through postmodern hells and they will usher us into heaven, a place that we already know and exist within but do not actually inhabit out of suspicion that it is not real. We must make this house our home again and natural theory will help us do it.
(it is worth saying here that I am not laboring under the delusion of being some great innovator. Many have noted the need to get beyond postmodern theory and many attempts have been made to accomplish, or at least the describe/prescribe the steps to undertake, the great task. Metamodernism, post-postmodernism, hypermodernism--these are some of the names proposed for the project. I think they all fail, terminologically and fundamentally, to get at the "root" of the problem. which is to say that they operate toward and against a perverse, distorted, and self-undermining baseline. As such, they relegate themselves to failure from the outset.)
-Green things - plant life, vegetation (insects)
-Brown things - earth and stone and rock (mammal, man)
-Red things - fire, destruction, energy
-Blue things - water (animal: fish and amphibian)
-Spirit - the wind, the breath of god, that gives rise to animal in each of the sphere (man)
