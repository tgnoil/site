JERRY SPRINGER

a sensational integrative force. a pillar of sanity and showmanship and good humor, shedding for us a wry, clear light on suppressed and subaltern (un)realities of his time and all time. 
profanities, grotesqueries, perversions: these were his trade and he plied it well, eyebrow permanently raised (and what do you think of THIS dear viewer?), tongue planted firmly in the cheek of a dawning millennium
note if you will how effortlessly he works the room, now from the audience, now from the stage--negotiating, initiating, deescalating--sprezzatura itself--toeing with unflappable poise the line between entertainment and exploitation, between theater and therapy, between man and his shadow
