my ocd fixates on material encumbrances of possession and the adttendant ontological encumbrances of identity. to have a thing, is to become a person who has it. i want to be no one, and thus i must have nothing, or as close to nothing as possible. chaos and disorder do not perturb me insofar as i did not cause them and am in no way obligated to attempt bring order upon them (and in so doing Subject myself to Object). i object to the Object, you see; I am subject only to Subject. or so i like to imagine.
