the realm of the social, figured as "The Party"--which to men is mere distraction from or adjunct to real life--is to women the whole of life itself; they cannot understand and thus resent/envy men's cavalier attitude toward it.
hence the thrill of repartee and the attraction of a cultured gentleman with whom to hold forth--finally, they think, a man who will play the game and do so with the subtlety and gravity it demands. i say gravity because--do not be fooled by their coquetteish insouciance, the coy flouncing about--such matters are of utmost importance to them. when a woman says or acts as is she just wants to "have fun", she means precisely the opposite, or at least something entirely different--she is ready to go to war.
