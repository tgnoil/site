TELECOM
wire-borne telecommunication as analogue to and corollary of wind-borne pollination, transmitters and receivers, packets or grains of gametic information conveyed/relayed across distance/difference (the prezygotic barriers) on the off chance of meaningful contact. TO: what end? to reproduce the signal, to propagate (over and out), to seed the earth with data, new nodes for the network, new branches grown between them.
this is the lifeblood of (post)modernity, the rite of spring, the great copper-y sex act...rhinitis, tinnitis, coitus....dead poles strung up astride their living brethren
