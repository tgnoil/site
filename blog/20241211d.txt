all truth is heretical. GOD as man? Word as flesh? blasphemy in the first degree.
only through the sacred profanation, the holy desecration of our most cherished ideals can we remain raw and attuned to the THING within the Thing within the thing.
truth abhors any attempt at the authoritative institutionalized formulation thereof.
as soon as it is codified, it ceases to become truth.
truth is a state, not a statement.
