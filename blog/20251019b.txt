Regarding Nihilism and Technology by Gertz:
Gertz is trying to juxtapose Heidegger and nietzche in teleological terms--which is to say the former asserts a telos (to function as witnessnes to and heralds of the destiny of Being) whilst the latter purportedly does not (advocating, instead of Being's totality, an undetermined becoming).

but i sense a teleological thrust in nietzche that I'm sure others have pointed out and that maybe he himself addressed, but nonetheless: the emergence of Overman is contingent, is it not, on and eventuated by the destabilizing and ennervating effect of nihilism, rallying the slave to throw off his shackles and grasp potentialities directly, rather than through divine proxy.

christianity set the stage for nihilism set the stage for post-nihilism sets the stage for overman. he was fated.

maybe this is imposing hegelian structure where it does not belong however. a way around might be a reframing of causality. imagine, if you will, four infinitely long halls in parallel, each with an infinite number of locked doors which permit advacement to the next hall in series.

the first is material, then form, then efficiens, the finalis.

the causes do not, as heidegger asserts, co-occur--rather they take place, contingently, in sequence and with indeterminate outfomes. the material juncture may not be bypassed to reach form, nor the efficent to reach finality.

there is a final state, but it is not written in the stars, or destind by Being, or encoded in the coming about of the causal fourfold.

rather it is a sequential series of choices which take place at four registers, each unlocked by turn.

and who or what then is the hand that unlocks? the will to power itself.
