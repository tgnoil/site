ive a slow mind; i'm no great wit. what i would say to young people who think the same of themselves is, who cares. no one is as smart or as dumb as they say or as they feel. allow yourself to become bored, then make the things you are compelled to make out of the boredom. dumb, smart-- make your things, there's not much time; there's all the time in the world.
