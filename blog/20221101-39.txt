PIG
A short tender film that weeps with its viewers. That celebrates life in light of (not in spite of) death. 
The truffle is mammon, the highly sought-after thing. The pig helps us find it. Only in the dying of the pig and the crying of the man does the known become felt. We eat the dying as remembrance, a sacred communing (Pentecost - ooohh I m on fire). Do not barter flesh for flesh, sucking tubes and roaring engines, the crass exchange. The bridges will fall, the lights will blink out, the high places will bebrought down. Seek ye first the pig and all these truffles will be added unto you. 
Note: The power of the pig is not the power of the dog. They both possess an animal keenness, but where the dog devours, the pig empowers. The dog is waiting fangs bared--in the high hills, the pig is rooting in the low wet forest. 
Also, see the piano as a pig-totem, a stand in for memory, a traumatic clinging, a blood sacrifice for the restoration of one s authentic voice (press play)
