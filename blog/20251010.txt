in the abundance of words, a truth blossoms. leave koans to the monks and their holy agonies and bony wisdoms; i have dallied long there in the hollow, wracked to cruciform.

it does not occur to one, til another sings of it trillingly, that there is nothing to be rid of-- sinward matter. it's essence that the trembling aspirant seeks to quell with false placidity, when coaxing would work the wonder twice so fast and more vitally.

and so, i will write to excess and in celebration; and so, I shun purity's subtraction and will add myself to myself, and learn to walk well and steadily, in my own pattering way.

what's that? you read a work, or watch one, and talk it out in a language you find or make suitable. nothing goes unremarked upon, even idly. truth blooms in that lilywork, those ornaments and scrolls.
