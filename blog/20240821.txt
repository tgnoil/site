taxation without representation is theft
this libertarian maxim holds true in the psychic level as well, where we all too often levy burdensome taxes on our selves (in the form of anxieties, fears, and self deprecation) without allowing for the full represenation/free expression of the unconscious, and in so doing rob ourselves of the great benefits it might offer, if permitted to flow naturally (increased confidence, creativity, etc.)
