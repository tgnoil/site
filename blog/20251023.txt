"the delusive screen of individuality"

"technologies" of ego are projective, medial, illusory, several degrees removed from what is real. 
i've always assumed this to be true.

but what if ego is not a false, intervening surface, but rather the "real thing" that the whole apparatus of negation and paradox and moral scruple was built to suppress.

in other words, what if I'm not imprisoned _in_ the cave; I'm imprisoned by the Cave, by the Analogy that positions me as bound, inert, and in need of ascent and "absorption" into Something Greater.

what if it's not transcendence i require but reindividuation.

what if Will is the breath of God in me, and attempts to deny or surrender that breath are a suicidal revocation.

I'm revisiting Nietzsche, as is probably obvious. I'm not a stranger to his ideas, but for some reason, I've never really felt their weight. 

Imagining, even experimentally, that the Will might be holy, something to be exercised fully and volitionally (not just penitentially relinquished), fills me a sense of urgency and potency I've never quite felt. maybe that's just Mania talking and not real Joy.

I'm still an ascetic-mystic in my bones, but for the first time i'm questioning whether that's...good

and it's embarrassing to admit--feels very juvenile, Philosophy 101 type shit--but I have really never considered what religion is doing on a mechanical fundamental level as regards the self.
