dadoes and blade runner are both about man vs. machine (vs. the World) and the redemptive/sacrificial process (i.e., the Christ-function) by which the one becomes or overcomes the becoming of the other.

in both works, empathic response is the mode (ethical, physiological) of distinction between the one and the other--flawed, though, as (1) the machine may pass, (2) the man may fail, and (3) the test terminates its own legitimacy (kill the thing that kills?)

the corporation has vested interest in beating the test, for the test is nature itself, a dark uncaring principle, but with a reflexive flaw, exploitable.

and the corporation is the Machine, perhaps, or the agent of the machinic impulse; to turn the world to Capital, it must disguise its intentions, pose as organic.

the bounty hunter is also the Machine, acting in reverse; to return the world to open Potential, and harvest the difference.

the process in both cases is legal and extractive--Life unto Death, Order unto Kipple. It depletes, as intention must within a closed system presumed open, accelerating its own decay.

so where is the Man? In the machine's mirror image.

in blade runner, this revelation is individual and sexual.

in dadoes, it is universal and philosophical.

in both, we are called to extra judicial penitence and love. for the law is ancient and has no face; it ends in a broken world. 

we are not on a spaceship, Boulding, nor the boundless prairie. We are on the hill to Calvary.
