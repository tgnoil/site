my deep aversion to change and situations I cannot control goes deep. i have squandered many crises and thereby generated much needless suffering, through my unwillingness to grasp bulls by their horns. No more. I contain boundless resource and will, and it must out. 
Does this mean I must fundamentally alter myself? no, you are still you...the shift in perspective will simply reveal to yourself the you you actually are in its fearful and powerful aspect.
