UNDISCOVERED SELF
Chapter 1   the plight of the individual in modern society
The plight of the man in modern society is active and invisible obstruction/suppression of self-knowledge (i.e., engagement in/with the irregularities of unmediated, individual experiences of the real) in favor of the massified ego-consciousness of the quasi-animate state that enforces statistical average through scientific rationality  
Chapter 2 - religion as the counter-balance to mass-mindedness
Distinguishing true religion from mere creed, Jung here points out the way in which the dictator states (and the credal religious institutions which subvert them in their insistence on credal conformity) usurps the God function, asserting the primacy of the statistical/scientific mode to the exclusion of any absolute reference point beyond the material/communal, thereby not only robbing man of his rights but also of his instinctive impulse toward the divine and the individuated experiences arising therefrom.
Chapter 3   the position of the west on the question of religion
In this chapter, Jung notes a  fatal parallelism  between the sterile moralities of the western Church-State and the collectivist materialism of the eastern Marxist dictatorships, insofar as both attempt to enforce a set of institutionally sanctioned belief and ideals, which in the case of the West represent a sad reduction/devaluation the riches of our inherited Judeo-Christian tradition with its emphasis upon the sanctity and dignity of the individual life. 
Chapter 4   man s understanding of himself
Positioning consciousness as that fundamental enigma, the precondition of being, which through constant friction against the body of unconscious memory and instinct generates dual and opposite impulses, Jung asserts that a balance must be struck between understanding of the subjectivities and knowledge of man s condition as a whole, in order that the individual man might reclaim the deep symbols of his deep past and integrate them in new and personalized ways, rather than sublimating them through mindless participation in the collective.
Chapter 5   philosophical and psychological approaches to life
In order to heal the disorder of the day (i.e., resolve the neurotic fractures that plague our modern consciousness), Jung asserts that we must undertake a systematic reinvigoration and reexamination of the life-giving symbols and primordial images that we ve inherited (conduits of dynamism and instinctive energies), taking care that we do not lose our shadow selves in collective ideals of statism and fetishization of the abstract Word.
Chapters 6 and 7   self-knowledge and the meaning of self-knowledge
In these final chapters, Jung further interrogates the obstacles which block man s achievement of self-knowledge (i.e. state-driven depotentiation/agglomeration of man as social unit and the isolation of his psychic energies), the means by which he may overcome these obstacles (i.e. personal acknowledgement of the dual nature of man, his shadow self, and the dynamic power of the psychological factor individual numinous encounter), and the importance of doing so (i.e. seizing this historical moment [Kairos   right time] to metamorphosize our tormented psyches, to deepen and broaden the consciousness, to unblock the dynamic flows of primitive  mana  that we might find the happiness and equability that only an individual self, never a state or collective body, can enjoy)
Further reflections
Ligotti and Jung both remark on the strange enigma of consciousness; however, for Ligotti a monistic materialist this puzzle cannot be addressed in any meaningful way as there is no one actually there to solve it (and thus nothing to solve), only agglomerations of matter which, through an unfortunate series of evolutionary/involutionary blunders, fancy themselves souls.
Jung, on the other hand, a committed dualist, is not so quick to dismiss parapsychological phenomena, instead maintaining the distinct possibility that there are psychic realities which supersede their physical manifestations.
In short, where Ligotti sees an illusion or delusion to be annihilated (objective scientific knowledge over subjective understanding), Jung sees a mythic adventure to be undertaken (individual irregularities brought to bear upon the statistical collective).
