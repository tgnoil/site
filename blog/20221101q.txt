SENSATION
Sensations are felt (hunger) 
Felt sensations suggest patterns (hunger subsides upon eating)
Patterns suggest selves (I eat therefore I am)
Selves suggest systems (others eat as I do)
Systems suggest ultimate reality (we seek a lasting Food)
Ultimate reality suggests ultimate unreality (we find a lasting Hunger)
Ultimate unreality suggests anti-systems (others hunger more than I)
Anti-systems suggest anti-selves (I starve therefore I am not)
Anti-selves suggest anti-patterns (eating subsists upon hunger)
Anti-sensation is not felt (...)
