Novelists are primarily driven by the sociological impulse; they are interested in human lives at scale.
Poets are phenomenologists; it is the singular experience that preoccupies them, the texture of the felt, the seen, the heard.
Short story writers are spiritualists; theirs is the realm of symbol and vision and parable.

Whichever impulse holds the most sway in a writer dictates the form he will excel at most.
