We are two abysses: a well staring at the sky.
- Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet

man, the biabyssal biped.

endless depth, boundless height, and the thin reflective surface that separates/mediates.

what's instructive about this metaphor, to me, is how I instinctively position myself as the well, and the sky as the Thing Beyond.

maybe that's how/why we get trapped in this painful cycle of "real-izing" ourselves (then "real-izing" we "real-ized" nothing)--our conception of "self" is limited to the one abyss, or to a single point between abysses. But we are two.
