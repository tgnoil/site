after a long vague love affair with the idea of eastern philosophy (really a kind of intellectual orientalism), my experience of actually reading Buddhist doctrine is similar to that of going over to a friend's house as a child, convinced that his is the far superior life, until you actually arrive at the Other Place and yourself put off by the strange smells, the strange rules, the alien shadows on the bedroom floor where you lie, listening to your friend snore.

And then, returning afterwards to the home you know, the smells and shadows of long acquaintance; how comforting--that is my experience, afterwards, of turning my mind to Christianity, its old familiar guilts and platitudes...how kind and parental and safe they seem. And how foolish was I to imagine myself better off anywhere else than here!
