we learn compassion like a child learns to speak. by mimicry. the words dont mean anything at first, but that doesnt make the child a liar. no more so is it disingenuous to inquire after or express care for someone elses wellbeing even if you dont "feel" any sort of emotion toward them in that moment. empathic fluency will come with time. the important thing is to observe attentively and to communicate actively, sensitively.
