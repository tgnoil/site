the autist seeks working knowledge and technical command; his obsession demands it.

the man of moods trifles with concept; he is taken with the idea of a thing, its trappings of language and culture, which he collects for the sake of impression. 

it is notional vs. actual interest, and this distinction has everything to do with interior, which the autistic lacks and the sensitive has in excess.

the latter possesses an internal mechanism, the former is one.
