BLACK SWAN
The white swan   pure, virginal, innocent, meek
The transformation   a stripping away, the orgasmic moment (le petit mort, the little death that brings life), goosepimpling of the flesh, a release, ecstasis/catharsis (the pill in the drink), a purging/urging (the dry heaving), white skin pierced from within
The black swan   paranoid, jealous, seductive, possessive
Velocity/motion - Tunnel vision, the train hurtling through the void, the sense of reckless velocity and momentum, the moment of impact (vehicular, suicidal, precipitous), a swan s dive into oblivion, locomotion
Lunar/solar - the black swan as a creature of the moon, tidal pulls, menstrual flows, madness, womanhood in all its neurosis; white swan as ascendant, a creature of light who--like the sun--must set, pierced by eros s bow (the glass shard   self-loathing as self-love:  I was perfect  - vanity vs. sanity) 
Doubling   prominence of mirrors, protagonist as her own antagonist, self-sabotage, pierced by a shard of the reflective substance, lines of fracture (the mother s wrinkled brow)
Claustrophobia   the music box, a prisoner of the pristine haven vs. the infernal ecstasy of the dance floor, claustrophobia of a different kind, a writhing mass of bodies.... womb as tomb, the overprotective mother, her leering portraits, ever watchful, the eyes that follow (maternal presence: think of Joon-Ho's film, a recurring theme of madness and the overprotective mother)
Cinematography   close shots to create a sense of disorientation, vulnerability, a sense of kinetic/frenetic motion
Sound design   ambient noise/voices on the peripheries, immersion and inversion, the creaks and groans of the environment, induced neuroses, high strung (scraping of the violinist s bow), cranial reverberations, (the tunnel, the chamber, the concert hall, liminal spaces designed to amplify sound), the orchestral  pit  as a kind of sonic maelstrom or void
Materiality   creaking and groaning, the sharp turn of the locks, slam of the doors, the shuffle, the tapping of pointe shoes
Appendage/plumage/unnatural growth   the cracking of joints, ligaments and tendons, long graceful lines, ugly webbings and contusions (obscured by the  down  of the assumed persona), nails, organics and mechanics
