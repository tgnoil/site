the yellow car 
of Hecate
may not be hailed 
at any dreary corner

its plush interior
yields to but one or two
a night

the thousand eyed foreigner,
say, 
Xanadu bound
whose dogs are tethered
loosely
to a streetlight

which grows long 
filaments
and bats them 
at the sailors passing

lucky man,
to be the object 
of such airs
as blow sweetly from that
slow mouth

to send out ships 
on odyssey
their tall pine masts
jutting 
though/against the fabric
of a low-slung sky

such airs 
and what a lucky one
to die, secretly,
upon a torrid errand

A., dearest,
foolish one,
best one,
I cannot kiss that thing upon the slab
I must find leaves to clothe you
or else to use for salve (the wound is grevious, oh the wound is shame)

Opened once, it closes fast again,
and who will pick the lock?
