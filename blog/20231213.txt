when you write or ideate from a place of generative analogue rather than discursive dialogue, you imbue both the reference and referent with new life, granting the former sensory weight/texture and the latter abstract depth. eschew reliance on existing theoretical frames and vocabularies which distance both the thinker and the thought from the prime source material of experience.
hang your thoughts on the world, strung from image to image, until with time a cross textual web is formed, to catch flies in.
