ACID ELEPHANT
Listened to acrimony s 1995 EP, acid elephant. Acrimony was a Welsh outfit that had a big influence on the UK stoner/doom metal scene at that time
Combining slow, heavy riffs (a la Sabbath) with psychedelic feedback loops, the EP taps into fuzzed-out frequencies of experience running below and beyond linear spacetime, fractals of the grim and ecstatic revelation.
