SERGEANT PEPPER
SERGEANT PEPPER
Sergeant pepper is an album about departure from mundane frames of reference, psychedelic loops of profusion and diffusion, a circumlocution of the unspoken absence at the core of everyday experience (be it amorous or familial, domestic or excursive, recreational or existential)
