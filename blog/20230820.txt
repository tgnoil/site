i wish i were a mechanism or a wound up a doll
no inner sense of schism or inner sense at all
  cogs and gears as fine as sand
  perambulating no mans land
  to do and be without compunction
  executing only function
i wish i were a robot with a hat
to keep my brain from knowing more than that
[to hide from my brain from knowledge of that fact]
