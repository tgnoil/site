CONTRACT
a contract implies a business relationship entered into freely and consensually to the (one would hope) mutual benefit of both parties; however, in the case of what is often called the "social contract," this appears not to be the case, as one is born into a state of compulsory societal participation with no real opportunity to renew or reaffirm the bond that was established by prior generations on their behalf or, increasingly, to ther detriment. it is almost as if the social contract functions less in the business sense (consensually signing a set of stipulations) and more in the epidemiological sense (as in contracting a virus or some state-altering condition), perhaps even in the covenantal sense (Noahic/Abrahamic promise, "your seed and their seed").
