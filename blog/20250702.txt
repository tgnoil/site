degrees of torment
on a hot porch pining
the mud dauber's nest
is occupied
by a single aberration,
who fled the ward one summer day
 dodging bottle rockets
all the way to Abilene

the purple mountains do not rise here in the distance;
 the car is on blocks.
my careless drafts
and little yearning lies
are a mountain
with a fiery tether
hymnopteran

the earth is marked with stings
that will erupt someday
and block the light out
and harden the hearts of men
in tortured poses

Pliny wrote of this
from his boat
paddling in circles
the oars were the furry arms of
a lover
who could not understand
the degrees of torment 
which separated 
them from the object of their grasping

Pliny wrote of this,
of the fault in the seismic code
that pushes bodies away and away,
attenuating mass,
   glaciated [vulcanized], rigidified
to drift apiece
as bottles lacking messages

one wishes the other contained
a script to make one come again,
the wasp's enlivening sting
but such is not the case
nor will be on a hot porch pining
nor will be in the cool Pompeiian nights
