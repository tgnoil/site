the gym is aesthetically, viscerally a horrible place, akin to hell with its clanking weights, its tortured groans, the stench. this is why we must go, not to "get fit," but to prove ourselves to ourselves in the infernal crucible. every afternoon i go, i sit in mt car before in a state of dread. then i grab my wter bottle, i gird my loins, and i descend. i inflict the senseless pain, i undergo the cruel ritual, and when i emerge, it is in a heroic aspect, as a man who has died and lived to tell of it.
