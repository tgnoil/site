Morning thoughts on mastery:
 Occurred to me that mastery is a state that can be only be observed or recognized from without, never from within (as self-recognition precludes the conditions for total creative conductivity).
The master does not feel himself to be a master (at least not in the moments where mastery has its fullest expression) because he is utterly absorbed in/one with the process. The moment his focus shifts from "task at hand" to "hand at task"-- becoming conscious of superficial distinctions between maker and making--he falters amateurishly, like Peter on the waves.
