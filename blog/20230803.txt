musings on antinatalism (to which I am naturally inclined) in light of the idea of "gift" (to which I am unnaturally drawn)

if all life is gift (which in my better moments I believe it be) and to give is better than to recieve (which experience has taught me) then we have a moral obligation to give life, to procreate. however, if all is gift, then so too is the ability to recognize all as gift, and furthermore, it is a gift our offspring may not themselves be given, with suffering generated as a consequence (i.e. the gift refused). So then perhaps withholding life from is the superior gift, since it precludes its own refusal.
