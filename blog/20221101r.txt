SKIN
Skin is the site of interface on which Touch occurs (soft interiority becoming felt to itself through contact with hard exteriority)
Sword (or axe) is the hard exteriority with potential to Wound
Wound is the point of awareness at which Skin feels itself unfeeling itself via violent Sword-touch (the violated boundary, exteriority ingressing upon interiority)
Armor is the preventative outerface that deflects Touch to protect Skin from Sword-Wound (and preserve discreteness of interior/exterior)
Scab is the reactive outerface that generates Scar
Scar is Skin that both resists and receives Touch, an omniface that grants exteriority its right to Wound and interiority its right to Armor  acknowledgement of the inner man as involution of the outer world and outer world as extension of inner man, each mediated across intersecting sites of sensory contact that can be neither protected nor transgressed without sacrificing the integrity, immediacy, and singularity of the Touch 
Let us then bear the wounding, revel in the scabbing, and develop with time a network of scars that gesture toward coaccomodation of the softness and the hardness, inside and out
