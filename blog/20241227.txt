writing tchnologies inscribed guilt into the collective conscious. under orality, thought is drawn into physical relation with body by way of tongue and mouth and teeth--the lingual act reconsecrates and reaffirms with each utterance the utility and vibrance of the word as a reverberant instance along a morphological continuum. there was no guilt for the premodern, for there was no past. only present participation in a shifting cloud of symbol and archetype made real by declaring it so, in a whisper or a plaintive cry or a howl or joyful song. 

where orality bends, the manuscript ossifies. 
no longer beholden to Body or Sense, it divorces thought from speech act, seizing hold of mind in a taxonomic rictus, scratching deep into our noetic substrates the notions of canonicity, immutability, authorial intent. hellfire. the God spectre forms in a kind of reverse incarnation, flesh made word. judgment hanging heavy above the inerrant Text, reverse incarnation. to live is to trangress. death the only expiation. 

and it is precisely from this-- from these pitiless laws of stone, vellum, newsprint--that the christ, the buddha, the tao deliver us by way of a return to the Oral, the Living Word that hums in and thru all things.
