I used to think that emotions were cancerous, that they took hold of you and ravaged you. they were, I believed, things to be excised or irradiated--malignant growths.

Now, I begin to see them differently--as indicators--not as a source of harm but as symptomatic of underlying conditions or states that must be heeded, savored; only then do they subside.
