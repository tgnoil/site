I'm pulling this out of my ass, but let's say ethic is interior system (motive, directive, what the work purports to "be about" in absolute terms); aesthetic is exterior system (shape, form, how the work purports to seem relative to other works).

An aesthetic ethic would be one where the motive of a work is purely formal; it is about nothing except what it seems to be, making no claims about the world or upon the viewer.

Again, this is an ass pull.
