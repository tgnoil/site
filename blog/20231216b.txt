the reason people are so desperate to travel is that they are strangers to their own bodies, minds, and intentions. we've been hollowed out and wired into the motherboard of technosociocapital. travel affords the analog illusion of autonomy and actualization, granting temporary reprieve from the unacknowledged but deeply felt sense of the _unnaturalness_ of it all...the dead eyed gutless subservience that characterizes modern lives. 
 
only the man who has torn the wires off, scratched away the silicon skin, rendered himself raw and naked of spirit, only he is content to go nowhere and do nothing. he has nothing to prove to himself or others. here, there; this, that---it's all the same to him. he is happy in himself. he is free.
