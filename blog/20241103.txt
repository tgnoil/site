there is no eschatological truth. to the extent that truth is anything, it is that which IS, now and now and now: the felt and seen and heard and immanently KNOWN. like gravity, we are in relation to it and granted presence by it, regardless of conscious ability or willingness to acknowledge and theorize that fact. the law and the truth of law abides in timeless present, regardless or projection and perception .  models, especially apocalyptic ones, have no truth bearing function--at best they are explanatory, at worst distortive.
