to assert that one ought not apologize or defer because it makes one seem weak is buncombe; he is strongest and most in control whom others esteem weak. you are at your most powerful when those around you view you as subordinate.  it is always better to move in shadows, behind the curtains of civility and conciliation. from there you may puppet the world with little risk of failure.
