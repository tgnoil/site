SAW
and the other day I watched saw. I liked how it opens, two guys waking up in the confines of some shitty death chamber. disorientation. Could have been a really cool piece if it had explored that space more fully and if the leads had chops. but the campy performances and clumsy flashbacks really reduced it to a cheap shock film with some mildly entertaining innovations on old horror themes
