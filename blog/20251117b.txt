i dont feel represented, in any meaningful way, by the things i do or say. which is why when i produce something "good" it amazes me, and why i have no real sexual scruple, why i am able to discuss deeply personal matters dispassionately. 

it seems that I perform myself through a discontinuous series of word- and act-instances that--on the _felt_ level-- have no bearing upon or connection to the wildly fluctuating state of H.-ness and the inarticulable experience of that state.

intellectually, though, i recognize and know that others presume such continuities to exist--though they don't and can't-- between what it is to be H. and what it is to act as H. they (others) assign to each instance a permanent weight, not merely as perceptual but as actual.

this gives me pause and concerns me greatly. it also excites, as it offers some approximate measure of self, received vicariously through the eye of the other. my hesitation at the threshhold of exchange, which is to say being fixedly known, outweighs, or else subsumes, the desire to thereby fixedly know, and so the gap widens, swallowing expression; no transfer can occur, if any ever did. i become a void to others, and so--incidentally, trivially, as it so happens--a void is what I must be.
