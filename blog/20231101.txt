ATHG works, against all odds, because it commits utterly to itself...no fourth wall breaking, no winking at the audience, no lazy non sequiturs. 

it doesnt feel like something that was made or written so much as discovered. an alien organic thing.

its nonsense, but internally cohesive nonsense that rings true in a fever dream sort of way. it has a complete confidence in itself, which comes i think from being truly the first thing of its kind, immaculately conceived. it doesnt have to "restrain" or "punch up".. . because its not a fiction. its an accurate depiction of an unhinged vision, a very real thing.
