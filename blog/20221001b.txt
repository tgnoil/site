Ligotti frames his exquisitely morose series of essays on antinatalism with the provocative (and unabashedly materialist) assessment of man as a  self-conscious nothing,  a pessimistic assertion which most would reject out of hand as morbid nonsense, running as it does counter to the near-universally held sense of optimism about our nature and future, as promulgated through the hackneyed maxims and trite platitudes that are so often trotted out in daily life, usually in the form of a neat, smug paradox (see Chesterton) intended to safeguard the illusory tranquility of one s selfhood against the barrages of logic and circumstance; however, through the very desperation with which these tortured epigrams are constructed and pronounced, the optimist shows his hand, betraying his own self as the true paradox in question, a self that is not a self at all, but rather an uncanny puppet which broken free of its strings can be neither fully toy nor fully boy only some uncanny conjoining of the two, an abomination of nightmarish aspect whose existence can be only loosely conceived of in works of supernatural horror but never definitively demonstrated, and certainly never widely accepted as fact, since in so doing, we would be forced to encounter the face in the mirror and find ourselves hideously lacking in one sense and grotesquely endowed in the other.
