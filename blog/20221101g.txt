GAME
I am compelled toward battlefield (and video games in general) by a combination of psychic drives including: competitive/exhibitive (desire to take the field against human opponents, incentivized toward optimal performance by well designed rulesets and clearly defined win/loss conditions), acquistional/completionist (desire to accumulate and showcase an inventory of honorifics, adornments, and items of relative rarity/finitude obtained through skill, persistence, and dumb luck), aggressive (desire to do violence to others and risk violence to self in pursuit of larger and justifiable aims), fraternal (desire to inhabit, participate in, and become recognized throughout communal/competitive spaces with delineated hierarchies and status indicators), and comedic/playful (desire to generate and appreciate situational tensions between expectation and instantiation with the advantage of distance and low-stake involvement).
As these drives have little to no expression in my primary realities, they compel me toward secondary realities, figured as the simulated battlefield, which is all the more enticing as it offers many of the chemical/instinctual/social satisfactions of warfare without the survival risks typically entailed thereby (the preservational drive)
