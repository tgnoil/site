X-MEN (& LIGOTTI)
Caught the end of X-Men: first class.
Was struck by its treatment of mutation as a thinly veiled metaphor for human consciousness and the strange set of powers with which it endows us, powers that set us irrevocably apart from the natural world, no matter how hard we try to reconcile our differences and subordinate our conscious capacities to its implacable whims. In conspiracy against the human race, Ligotti also uses the vocabulary of mutation and perversion as analogical to man s self-awareness and he too would agree that we are set apart to suffer the weight of difference and dual personhood as both selves and non-selves.  However, with its beatification of Professor X as apostle/martyr of optimism, (in contrast to the grim Nietzschean gospel of Magneto), the film holds onto the possibility of redemptive action, of a new symbiosis between the mutant and the man, the conscious and the unconscious...a softening of the evolutionary toward alleviation of pain and accommodation of difference. Ligotti makes no such allowances and would, along with Zapffe and other pure pessimists of his ilk, decry the film as an admittedly inventive but ultimately insufficient attempt at preserving an unfounded future that we are unlikely to achieve
