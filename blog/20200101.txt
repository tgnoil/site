SPIN*

Ken Moore was an appliance salesman, working for the company that shared his name. It seemed too convenient, too unlikely. "Like the washing machines?!" "Any relation?" Yes, like the washing machines. No, no relation.

Ken's numbers were good; he moved units. Not on charm or persistence or any of the usual virtues of his trade, but by a discreet lack of them. 

While his collegeaues stalked the floor, wheedling hapless indecisives, Ken took his mark in one of the little mock display kitchens, quietly perusing an owner's manual. Like a stage actor when the lights come on, suspended in time.

If they want something, they'll come and ask; if they don't they won't.

Best, Ken thought, to let the buyer be. Where he got this philosophy was from a book he read in childhood about a wise old goose and a little gosling. 

The gosling would poke its head through the narrow bars of the gate in the park, saying, "I can fit through, see, I'm as nimble as can be. What do you think of that old goose." The old goose would clear his throat: "the bars are wide as three feathers, no more and no less."

The gosling, of course, became a goose himself, but kept at his silly games. And each time, without a note of remonstrance, would come the old refrain.

Just the facts, the specs. Just declarative statement about the width of the bars and the spaces between. Were there any deals at the moment. Yes, 50% on the HE top loader over there. 2 year warantee. 

Any compact models? Any eco friendly options? Yes, and here they are. And here is what they do. And here is their capacity.

At the end, the careless bird got his head stuck, but that wasn't the point at all. The book was a pangyeric to restraint. It was the greatest thing he had ever read, but he hadn't read much.
