QUANTA - the discrete transmission 
QUALIA - the received characteristics

the semiotic configuration of plato's cave: the source, the surface, the thing (absence and presence), the man (author and reader/priest and prisoner)

the source is excitation of universal functions or loops, pure quanta.

the surface is known boundary against which source is registered.

the thing is manipulable reference point, projected as absence onto surface by source. 

the man is a source-thing, capable both of manipulating and being manipulated. as reader, he beholds; as author, he beholds beholding.

source enables, thing blocks, surface receives, man processes. 

surface < thing < source 

the eye is surface. all things are beheld upon surface by way of source. what the thing is is not known. what the source is is not known. only that it is felt is known. and that knowing becomes truer the fewer surfaces there are mediating the perceptive process.
