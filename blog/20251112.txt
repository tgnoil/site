work is the task you are set to by some figure, a parent or parent proxy; Work is the Task you set yourself to. the former is childish, necessary, (incentivized by necessity), and able-to-be-done; the latter, as a state of actualized alignment between potential and the kinetic, is indefinite, superfluous, heroic, and maturational--the mark of the Man.
happy is he whose work is his Work.
happier still is he whose Work is his all.
