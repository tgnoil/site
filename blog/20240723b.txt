the actual (and increasingly the stated) purpose of the education system is not to create curious well-informed individuals but a compliant and docile populace. america's rapid "decline" (relative to metrics that "matter") is a direct result of this, i think. collectivism has its merits, on the local level at least, but they become drawbacks at scale. the collective does not invent, it does not innovate, it does not drive growth. That's why communism always becomes authoritarianism; bereft of the engine of individuality, the inert state demands a strong and charismatic hand (which turns quickly to an iron fist). 
if you want to see the origins of the populist movement, look no further than the modern classroom (school as prison, students as inmates. their crime? having been born a self. "oh we will standardize that out of you in no time," say the well-intentioned educators, "we will make you an Average Citizen yet.")
look at their dead vacant eyes, sapped of vitality, dried-out tinder, awaiting the reactionary spark. the conflagration will spread (is spreading) fast and wide, carried on the winds of a nameless anger. 
like all civilizations, we have done this to ourselves, we have created the conditions for our own destruction. it could be no other way.
