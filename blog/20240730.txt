there is no romance* left in nature; photography tamed it. there is no romance left in sex; therapy tamed it. there is no romance left in the Digital; google tamed it. there isn't even any romance left in revolution; marx tamed it. art? there's no spirit in it. religion? there's no art in it.

narcoleptic, anhedonic, we languish in dreams of the bygone, foregone, orgone.

the only romance left is pain--mute, bare, individual. we must ravish ourselves with the whips and chains of _hyperawareness_, set ourselves to the path of the enlightened sadist, bodhisattvas of pain

*romance is the idea of the human in the more-than-human AND of the more-than-human in the human. it flows both way, mystically, "naively." anything that attempts to singly unhumanize the human (models) OR to humanize the more than human (morals) works against romance.
