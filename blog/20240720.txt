I come time and again to this point, never beyond it: to fight or surrender. To fight is to pick a side, to stake yourself on a particularity. To surrender is to lay down the notion of sides, to resign yourself to the All-ness.

When I pick a side, I look around and see people dying, and quickly lose whatever taste for the fight I imagined I might have--return to neutral zone, crestfallen and humbled. 

When I surrender, I look around and see people living, and quickly lose whatever capacity for _detachment_ I imagined I might have--return to neutral zone, hot and lusty.

And when I attempt synthesis, that is to engage both impulses simultaneously in some way, to bloody the white flag or dress the red wound, to actively withdraw or to passively engage, I look around and cease to see people at all, just formless smears of half-ideated motion, a kind of mania or derealization--return to neutral zone, dazed and brimming. 

I need to be taken prisoner, conscripted, or else killed. But I cannot be left to my own devices much longer.
