FAVELAS AND FUNK
 the city is beautiful, but only on the outside. On the inside it is dirty 
I don t think he was speaking only of the city, but of its inhabitants as well of human nature.
The favela dwellers spend their time in beauty parlors, salons, barber shops they spend their meager earnings on expensive sneakers and clothes (beautifying/adorning). But when night falls and the beat drops, the trappings fall away and am is revealed in his true and most fundamental aspect: as animal, as beast. Violent, sexual, vital/virile.
Law and order compresses and encloses the base desire (pressurized chamber, trigger pull, discharge), but it cannot stamp it out. On the contrary, the greater the suppressive force that is exerted upon the favela (the human heart of darkness), the larger and more powerful it grows. 
The poet seeks a better way, a synthesis of funk and finery. But like the kite, he is string-bound, at the mercy of his operator. For all our acrobatics, our dramas, our romances, our flourishes and imagined freedoms, we are derivative, conditioned, compelled by forces both interior and exterior.
