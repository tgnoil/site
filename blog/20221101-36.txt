MOTHER
Mother
A film about madness, the Bacchic frenzy of a mother s love
A film about memory, lost and gained
A film about vengeance turned upon the avenger
A film about guilt, the needling pricks of conscience
A film about blunt force trauma, the hit and run of circumstance
A film about remedies, poisons, wild concoctions of fact and fiction
A film about law and (dis)order of the mind
A film about carnal knowing, maternal unknowing (the womb & the phallus)
A film about blood, discharge, traces bodies of evidence 
A film about the scars and tissues we accumulate, then take care to hide
A film about fire and rain life s junk in a wet, smoldering heap
