 environmentalists/conservationists are not idealists; they are pragmatic humanists. "How do we persist as a species in light of entropic decay and diminishing energy stock." Their answer seems to be in moving toward a closed-system mindset where all outputs function as inputs, and where general "well-being" is granted equal status to other capital stocks in the econosphere. They see the "world set" in terms of its limitations and constraints, and have little to no faith in human abilities to overcome them. "save the earth" is rhetorical sleight-of-hand for "save humanity from itself."

Capitalists are the true idealists; they are romantic humanists; the world is the Wild West to them, an illimitable plain of productive possibilities. To them, notions of "unsustainability" and "inevitability" are affronts to the human spirit, ingenuity, and self-determination. "How do we maximize our resources, and what our species can do with those resources, within a lifetime?" Very carpe diem.

The spacemen guard their collective stock carefully, suspiciously. Repairing and preparing against the inevitable. The cowboy spits at fate, yeehaws, and gallops headlong into the entropic shootout
