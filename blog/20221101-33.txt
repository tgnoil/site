JACKASS 4
Saw jackass 4, thinking about why it s made such a lasting impression on the male imagination.
Of course, there s always been a fascination with the figure of the daredevil, the reckless stuntman (tightrope walkers, street performers, sword swallowers). But Jackass represents a unique variation on this tradition, as the feat is not to avoid bodily harm but to subject one s self to it in the form of vulgar pranking, voluntary mutilation, and masochistic violence specifically against the male member.
As is suggested by the opening action sequence of a phallic Godzilla wreaking havoc on the city, this fourth installment of the much-beloved/-maligned franchise is not just a crass romp down memory lane (although it is that), but it more so represents the aging jackass crew s attempt to defend/recapture their manhood/vitality precisely by endangering it.
I think back to Parsiful and the hero s journey. The only way to heal the fisher wound is to wound oneself through the painful divestment of the mother complex. Hence the prominence of nakedness and exhibitionism (and hence the absence of Bam, who in his grief for his Dunn still clings to the protective garment of adolescent attachment). It takes a pure fool to draw laughter from the unlaughing maiden and thereby, even in the autumn of life, achieve a kind of immortality or knighthood in the round table of male fraternity.
