Remembering that THIS is life. I am in it at this moment and this moment and this moment. 
Even when "present," I find I am simply imagining a future wherein I am "present," or imagining myself imagining that.
It does not "get better." There is no then-state/later-state to bring about the long-awaited.
Only now-state and now-state and now-state. This is life, I'm in it now.
Remembering that. Thanks.
