PROFESSOR OF DESIRE
Just finished Roth s *Professor of Desire*. A light read. The protagonist is a smart good-looking Jewish kid with a flair for the theatrical, a gift for the rhetorical, and a taste for the carnal. Equal parts libido and cogito, David Kepesh attempts to navigate the treacherous waters of desire and despair--Scylla of mind on the one hand (compulsive self reflection, paralysis by analysis) and Charybdis of flesh on the other (hopeless susceptibility to female charm, hedonic abandonment).
The psychosexual coordinates of David s academic/erotic career can, I think, be charted relative to his major literary influences at each stage: the typewriter/drum (the syncopated allure of showmanship and stagecraft, a la Herbie s flatulent exhibitionism), Dostoevsky (the crime of morose association with  practicing homosexual  Jeselnik, the punishment of Silky s sex withheld) Icelandic verse (the epic saga of Brigitte s lust and Elizabeth s lament [keening/kenning]), Chekhov (the domestic strangulation of his failed marriage to the exotic Helen), erotic verse (the incorrigible Baumgarten and his unflinching vulgarities, welcome distractions from the glum post divorce caesura), and at last Kafke (the sense of futility and doom pervading even David s  happy ending  with sensible, tender young Claire, wife material if ever there was such a thing). Desire: cupid s poison tipped arrow, the sweetness unto death (petit mort)
