ANOTHER ROUND
Four jaded middle age high school teachers decide to test the hypothesis that humans are born with a BAC deficit of 0.05, adopting on an ostensibly experimental basis Hemingway s famous habit of daylong alcohol consumption with abstinence on nights and weekends. At first, the effects are positive, with noticeable improvements in professional performance and interpersonal connection, both with family and students, but as addiction sets in, their project spirals out of control, with Martin losing his wife, Tommy losing his job, and the group of friends losing Tommy (to, it is implied, suicide), after a brief period of relative normalcy and sobriety.
Wallowing in his grief, Martin seems poised for a headlong dive back into his old ways when he receives a text from his wife indicating a desire to reunite, setting the stage for the admittedly very cool dance sequence where mikkelsen prances through a spray of champagne before the closing freeze frame of his spontaneous leap into the bay. 
The film feels, to put it kindly, a bit maudlin, the premise a bit contrived. Even the reference to Kierkegaard, dropped during the oral exam of an anxiety-ridden student (who, by the way, passes the exam on his teacher's suggestion to  liquor up  beforehand) comes off as forced. 
However hamfisted it may be in execution, the film does gesture toward some interesting thematic interplays of anxiety, sociality, and sexuality, all bound up in alcohol as Libation/Liberation, the Effusive Spirit, the celebratory/revelatory communion that compels us as people and as a species toward our individual and collective leaps into the great unknown where loss and possibility reside hand in hand.
