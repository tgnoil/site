organized religion can only give us gods, which we need. but it cannot give us God, which we are.

the Christ figure stands not only as the God-man but as the God-god-man. bridging the gap between the high, the low, and the boundlessness beyond and within. 
no man cometh to the father but by me (myself, I).
