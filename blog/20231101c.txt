STAV
i dont begrudge stav his newfound niche. i find him increasingly annoying and hacky, but here are few well known comedians who dont fit that description. the fact is, to acheive mainstream success, you need a clearly defined image: the simpler and stupider the better. stav's image is fat horny guy--played out maybe--but he certainly fits the part. i honestly dont think hes working under delusions of grandeur or genius--he just wants to be a household name, so hes leaning into the one angle that could feasibly get him there. tldr; you cant hold people to standards that exceed their ambitions.
