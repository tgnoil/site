I think maybe the problem with political theory and 'proving' it  is that to do so requires a level of objectivity and environmental control that's hard to achieve (in any kind of ethical way at least) when the experimental subject at hand is human lives. It sort of demands that you approach the world as Laborotory.
(And how does one 'sterilize' the instruments of life at scale?)
So you could think about every new thought system as a hypothesis, and every new regime as a clinical trial.
the greater the scale of the study, the more devastating the consequences of a failed hypothesis. 
So maybe a bottom-up politic is called for...a new social science where the subjects wear the lab coats. Or is that what democracy was intended to be? we've seen how that worked out.
Theurgy - now that might be the ticket. 
>Could it be a long project (or pedagogy?) of discovering the size and scale our kind of animal is able to live with the dignity our kind of animal deserves?
Dignity would have to be the operative/anchoring element there. We would have to start from a shared assumption of the nature of that dignity, else the pedagogue becomes the demagogue and desecrates the synagogue, i.e., scale becomes an end in itself and the long project gets cut short, turning bloody or even apocalyptic....
...at which point, maybe only the theurgic invocation (praxis<>theory) can save us. 
maybe we have to sacrifice 'our kind of animal' to invoke 'our kind of animal's kind of god'
