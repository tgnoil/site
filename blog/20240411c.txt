the gym is hell, a din of clanking and pained grunts.. the hot stink of lust and ego hangs heavy. Set to futile tasks of picking up and putting down, contorting in mirrors, stretched out on weighted implements, the sinners writhe and thrust in self imposed torment for sins uncommitted. there is no god in this place, only metal and flesh and our terror, our hatred of both.
a long, solitary walk is heaven by comparison. it purifies. body soul and mind left better for it.
