falling down is a good film but not a great one. michael douglas is so soft and deft in his derangement; you buy it, even when it tends too cartoonish and allegorical. and it is an allegory, the director said as much, for the obsolscence of an old America and that America's dream.

so Douglas is a revelation. Duval is the foil; he also has a daughter he cannot see, a wife who thwarts him. but he is "one of the good ones", in the film's conciliatory gesture--i.e.c that same America that produced Douglas's killer also gave us the mild mannered peacekeeper with his unerring sense for the truth of the matter.

loss has not addled him; he has a manhood left to reclaim. 

D-fens offends, but cannot forfend judgement day. for all the stolen firepower, his final draw's a child's toy.

the birthday, that's significant. his, Foster's, death day. Prendergasts's final day on the force. 

so it's an allegory, thoroughly unbelievable. it's so full of menace, so discomfitting...I felt a masterwork coming on in the opening scene, and into the gangland sequemce.

but then it escalates too fast, and Duval's storyline did not hit quite right. there's a tidiness to it that-- hard to say exactly-- feels too tidy and plotted out and of its time.

but the tone is distinct-- a hot ultraviolent sheen on it that I dont think ill soon forget.

foster may not be on the level of a Bickle or a Bateman, but hes damn close.
