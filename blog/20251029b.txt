i went to a witch named edna on an internet forum

understand
this is not a poem.

she claims to offer insight from beyond
through astral means

when I stage my plaint to her, falteringly,
there is some some sense
of travel and receipt
like wing-ed Mercury 
missal borne

though this is not a poem
   it lacks the characteristic marks
still it feels like movement
and still it feels like handled clay

so too the rendering of Edna's 
correspondence
   some higher principle at work
die struck to form and cast 
among the stars
which relay my signallings to her
and hers to mine
 in a faint but wondrous way
