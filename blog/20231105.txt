hart's experience of God is primarily a rearticulation or synthesis of the philsophical underpinnings of the theistic tradition (ontological, epistemological, and phenomenological) and secondarily a defense of that tradition against naturalism, on the strength of causal principles--that is, all contingencies per accidens must arise from a non-contingency per se, which, all of our ludicrous attempts to derive from existence a reason for existence notwithstanding, is best described as an immanent, transcendent God. it is against this point and this point alone that any attack on Hart's argument must be launched, if it is to have even an off chance of striking true. to wit: why must there be uncaused cause? who's to say that the apparent contradiction of an infinite causal regress (absent some supernatural source) does not arise simply from our flawed understanding of the nature of space-time? on what grounds is the necessity of non-being asserted?
