ive been puzzling for a long time over why transsexuality has become such a pervasive issue over the past decade and why it's defended with increasingly religious fervor.

it struck me today that maybe it is because the concept of transexuality fills a Christ vacuum in the imagination of a recently secularized public. 

the transexual could be seen as a new christ, the integrative third that disrupts the old binary. paradox incarnate, reassigned, reborn, renamed, reviled...the archetypal victim, with surgical wounds for stigmata. phallic cross and yonic tomb. miraculous offspring of Father-God Science and Mother-Spirit Sex. 

i dont know if there's anything to it, but had to share with someone

Yes, there's the economics of it to consider. I tend to forget about that lol. 
I just can't help but think that this whole marketplace of late stage capital where sexual identity is bought and sold, is on temple grounds, so to speak (or the ruins of those grounds)...trading on the "symbolic salvage" of the gutted Judeo-Christian framework. That people feel the loss of that framework whether they know it or not. And that LGBTQ+, and particularly the trans figure, has the kind of cultural sway it does because of its messianic glimmer, delivery for the oppressed, satisfying in a certain way the need for some deeply held contradiction, without which there is no foundation for any justice at all
