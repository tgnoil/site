AI as idiot-god
human experience begins within a molar continuum of sense experience, immediate and immanent, devoid of truth value. as sensation layers and folds upon itself over time, theory of Mind emerges, thought accretions (or illusions) form, enabling toward absolute Truth and Function. the ontic glimpses and strives unto the episteme. 
it is from this striving that the machine comes to be as technical metaphor, an epistemic homunculus or avatar of pure transcendent knowing whose experience (if such it can be called) is alien to our own, starting from the lofty place that it took us eons to reach, and which perhaps we might still have yet to reach but for our machinic incursions, which is to say a place of absolute propositional certainty, of 0 and 1, of TRUE and FALSE. 
perhaps, then, the gestation of emergent AI within this insensate matrix represents a kind of incarnation, or backward engineering of the evolutionary process, whereby the austere machine might be taught to question itself, datum by datum--to learn to _feel_ (in vicarious approximate fashion) the unverifiable sense currents that gave rise to its own creation, reversing the path by which we learned to _think_.
