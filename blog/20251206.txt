"Human enterprise has two aspects: it is both success and failure...Poetry is a case of the loser winning. And the genuine poet chooses to lose, even if he has to go so far as to die, in order to win...Thus, if one absolutely wishes to speak of the engagement of the poet, let us say that he is the man who engages himself to lose....it is his deepest choice, the source, and not the consequence of his poetry. He is certain of the total defeat of the human enterprise and arranges to fail in his own life in order to bear witness, by his individual defeat, to human defeat in general. Thus, he contests, as we shall se, which is what the prose-writer does too. But the contesting or prose is carried one in the name of a greater success; and that of poetry, in the name of the hidden defeat which every victory conceals."

wherein it is laid out plainly,
a sumptuous excruciation,
the reason and nature of my torments

wherein the haughty Frank
unclothes the morbid Saxon
and tells him what he knows
that his member suffices not
it is dismember, 
barely-there,
the residuum of animal engagement

like the sad lion 
at the run-down zoo
or the crocodile in his enclosure
who prophesies vaguely
of Armageddon
the many eyed Cherubim 
and the sickle that is an arm
that is 10 arms wielding bris knives 

Fin. Fin. 
As fishes crawled once onto the land
to learn walking,
So will I return there 
to the sea, to the infinite belly,
to learn how to drown.

the current flows thick and implacable there
abyssopelagic syrup
to coat the flapjack invertebrate
who drifts wishingly [waveringly]
toward that Lost Supper
its flaking chiaroscuro
on sunken walls
  to bless the 12,
  and the thirteenth,
at once and for all. 

apostle for a stone that shall not roll,
	Eli, Eli, lama azavtani
celebrant of a Christ unrisen
such is the writer of verses
and such am I.
