PREWILL
Christianity is built on and replete with paradox: 3 as 1, god as man, death as life, loss as gain. why then is it so hard for the calvinist-arminian hardliners to accept ordination as agency, divine sovereignty as a kind of freedom?
proponents of one side may grant slight concessions to the other, but stubbornly maintain the primacy of their preferred trait ("its true that we have a certain amount of freedom, BUT gods sovereignty trumps all" or "its true that god is sovereign, BUT never in such a way that it interferes with free will").
by "weighting" the doctrinal balance in this way, they lose the richness of the paradox at hand and the deep fundamental truth it contains. 
-the divine nature is both God and Man in equal measure. 
-christ's sacrifice as much a death act as it was a promise of resurrection 
-we are entirely free to choose; we are utterly and irrevocably bound. (Pre-will)
both can be fully and mutually true. put down the theological pitchforks.
