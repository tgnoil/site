9 BILLION NAMES OF GOD
i read the 9 billion names of god, titular short story in a collection by arthur clarke. very short and simple, perhaps a bit too simple.. concept seems a bit thin.. some tibetan monks use a supercomputer to generate all possible names of god via brute force permutation...9-vharacter strings in a language of their own devising. upon completion of the task, the world ends. huh? the thematics are fleshed out not at all. gestures lazily at the joint & respective functions of religion, language, and technology and--I suppose--the thanatophilia thay underlies them all. maybe the mechanics of the modern world are simply hastening an inevitable exhaustion/depletion of all semantic possibilities, at which point the symbols cease to signify and the stars blink out one by one, "without fuss" (i liked the ending)
