i revisit old confrontations and exchanges endlessly and compulsively, not to better understand the other, but to reassure myself that I already understand them. i return in defense of myself against any objections that might be raised by shadowy strawmen. I do not engage these objections logically, for they are not really objections in any kind of propositional sense. They are my own vague fears and sensations, foremost among which is that of being misunderstood, trapped, thought ill of. 
Because the objection is not logical, I cannot refute it logically--I can only read and reread, enact and reenact, the words and deeds of a past self, in an indulgent and fawning way, sometimes even adopting the role of the other, rewriting their part to fit my script, fashioning profuse apologies and admissions of love and guilt and epiphany, which I beneficently accept and illuminate. 
In this way, I approximate self esteem. but it is a mockery.
