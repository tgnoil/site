POWER OF THE DOG
The power of the dog is also its weakness: unscrupulous hunger
OR the power of the dog is: its ability to break the rabbit s neck 
OR simply, the power of the dog is its animal keenness
If you starve the dog, it will bite 
Peter wore gloves and Phil did not
the blood sacrifice, the scalpel, the diseased carcass
cut it down, cut it open, sew it closed...so that life may go on 
teach me to ride and I will teach you to die
gently, the scalpel prevails (surgical vs classical)
a field of flowers made of music (the solitary picking, the raucous tune   above and below)
press them in a book, or light your cigarette with them
hiss of fire in water
the pure stink of the man s world vs the stifling perfumes of femininity 
Repression, ingression, a dog s mouth waiting in the far-off hills
