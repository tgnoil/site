the truly self-aware person is aware of their unawareness and of the fact (and it is a fact) that the better part of the self lies unexplored, far beneath the waking mind, in vast networks of sub-conscious interior.

So it is not hyperbole to say that the man who claims self-knowledge or awareness of self is almost certainly lying, for were it true, he would know it to be false.
