we inflict our desires on the world. there is no crime. to be violently parted from our false decency is orgasm. the liar wants to be decieved. the murderer wants to die. the thief wants his fears stolen. 

anf the pederast fears his ugly penis; he will spare no terror to know that terror, to fuck himself virginal. 

we want not to want that.
