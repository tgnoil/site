a cigarette is a proof of life, one that, ironically, kills. but this does not detract from the satisfaction; it heightens it.

when I look down at the butts in the can or tray where I have stubbed them out, I see moments of life, five to ten minutes each, of contemplation, of quiet thought, of day dream--increments both additive and subtractive--shortening my overall lifespan, yes, if the statisticians speak truth, but granting my diminishing moments, even the most mundane, a richness and existential depth far outweighing the deleterious physiological effects.

mine was the practiced hand that extracted each machine rolled paper tube from its package, mine the hand lit it, that held it lazily between pointer and middle finger, bringing it to mouth for lazy drags at intervals of my choosing.

wreathed in funerary smoke, I am drawn to my own death, ceaselessly; it stimulates, it enlivens, it brings all things to a point, a little cherry of fire, that crumbles slowly to ash the delicate paper cylinder of my Being-in-the-World.

that nodule in my lungs, call it malignant, assign to it a "Stage," but I tell you it is an organ, pineal and musical in function...and the wheezing of its bellows attests to some great celestial instrument in the sky.
