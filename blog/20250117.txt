whatever you are doing is worship if you do it fully. however you are feeling is joy if you are feeling it fully. wherever you are is heaven if you're there entirely.
it's never necessary to rethink, only to dethink. 
no more "fresh starts" no more "new pages"
they are palimpsests that bear the imprints and erasures of past scribblings. 
if you begin to feel lost or overwhelmed or dead, do this: say how you feel, where you are, who you are with, what you see, why you like those things, and what you intend to remember about them.
