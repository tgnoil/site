HOBBYWHORES
hobbyism is dreadful, odious. mild mannered hordes of middle age castrati buying overpriced starter kits, proofreading replies to noone on dying internet forums. I get nausea from it: their sense of dutiful, put on industriousness, of practiced curiosity, of sallow well being. 
pursue the thing with mad, singular, obsessive abandon; or else do it sullenly, begrudingly, poorly. do it because you must or not at all. drop the farce. i address myself.
