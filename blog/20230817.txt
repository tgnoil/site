to be a person in the world
is a hard-to-swallow pill
to be a person that's a girl
is harder to swallow still

yet I've found there is a way
to make the pill go down
just take a sip of silence;
it's as easy as it sounds

turn off loud thoughts;
they only serve to parch and to constrict
and only you can counteract 
the pain that they inflict

and how? by simply taking hold 
of what is right before you
the cup of present happiness
will never not restore you

drink deeply of experience
aware and unattached
your self inflicted weariness
will turn to joy unmatched

forsake imagination 
of all past and future troubles
accept the gift of here and now
like children blowing bubbles

our feelings and our fantasies
will drift up and away
so take a sip of silence
and know it's all okay'
