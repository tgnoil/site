    antinatalism is not a mere selfish aversion to children, nor is it a perverse misanthropy. It is a highly coherent, compassionate, and rational (and thus unpopular) position, namely, to procreate is to generate suffering without the consent of the sufferer.
    An antinatalist needn't hate life or hate humanity--he need only recognize that the perpetuation of humanity is the perpetuation of keen and conscious suffering that is not and cannot be outweighed by incidental pleasures.
    It is within our power to end human pain in a dignified and moral way--i.e., abstaining from procreation. No one would be harmed and untold unborn generations would be spared.
    It will never happen of course. But it could. And it probably should.
